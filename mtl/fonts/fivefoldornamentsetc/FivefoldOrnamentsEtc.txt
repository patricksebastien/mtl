    Five-fold Ornaments etc. dingbats font, by AnonMoos

This font contains mainly decorative abstract geometric patterns with
five-fold symmetry or quasi-symmetry (over 90 such glyph shapes are
included).  The font code is licensed under the SIL Open Font License,

In this font, the main five-fold ornaments have been assigned to
upper-case letters and punctuation symbols; some flowers are assigned
to numerical digit characters; while some unclassified five-fold
ornaments are assigned to lower-case letters l-z.  This font project
originated as devising supplemental symbols (and revised versions of a
few symbols) for the Discordian dingbat fonts (version 2 of 2006,
named "Fnord-Hodge" and "Fnord-Podge") by toa267 (a.k.a. mcqueen269 or
"the other anonymous"); for this reason, a few miscellaneous symbols
(which are less symmetrical, or are not five-fold at all, or which
have specific reference to the Discordian font) are assigned to
lower-case letters a-k.  In accordance with the original toa267 font,
all characters fit within a 1000-point by 1000-point box.

Basic unelaborated pentagon and pentagram shapes (which can be found
in many other fonts) are not included.

Version 1.1:  There are now fifty ornaments assigned to diacritic
letters (characters 193-250).


                List of decorative symbols in the font

General five-fold ornaments (upper-case letters and punctuation):

   A: Revised version of toa267 spiral "pentskellion" symbol, with

      in this font are by AnonMoos.

   B: Five-fold spiral pinwheel.

   C: One visual interpretation of the Galactic Library glyph (Library
      Institute emblem), based on the general verbal descriptions in
      David Brin's "Uplift" series of science-fiction novels (a

      an overall enclosing spiral).

      central element as a butterfly and/or labrys motif...
