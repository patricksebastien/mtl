> The other question \; what's a 'waveshaper' algorithm. Is it simply
another > word for distortion? A typical "waveshaper" is some function
which takes an input sample value X and transforms it to an output
sample X'. A typical implementation would be a look-up table of some
number of points \, and some level of interpolation between those points
(say \, cubic). When people talk about a wave shaper \, this is most
often what they mean. Note that a wave shaper \, as opposed to a filter
\, does not have any state. The mapping from X -> X' is stateless.
Some wave shapers are implemented as polynomials \, or using other
math functions. Hard clipping is a wave shaper implemented using the
min() and max() functions (or the three-argument clamp() function \,
which is the same thing). A very mellow and musical-sounding distortion
is implemented using a third-degree polynomial \; something like X'
= (3/2)X - (1/2)X^3. The nice thing with polynomial wave shapers is
that you know that the maximum they will expand bandwidth is their
order. Thus \, you need to oversample 3x to make sure that a third-degree
polynomial is aliasing free. With a lookup table based wave shaper
\, you don't know this (unless you treat an N-point table as an N-point
polynomial :-) Code : float waveshape_distort( float in ) return 1.5f
* in - 0.5f * in *in * in \;;
