This font was made using MS Paint and ScanFont 3.12. This is a freeware font. You may use it for any form or purpose. The only restrictions are that you cannot claim ownership or authorship of the font or its' glyphs.

I was working on a different font when a found a picture on Flickr called Glass Snakeskin. I experimented with it as a monochrome image, and was sufficiently intrigued to look for other images that were similar. I didn't use the Glass Snakeskin picture for this font, as it was too similar to the picture used for the Q,R,U and V glyphs. I might use it, if there's a sequel.

The 52 glyphs in this font, (A-Z in upper and lower case), were made from just eight pictures. I used the flip/rotate feature in MS Paint to create either four or eight  versions of each glyph, forward, reversed, and perpendicular Each original picture was flipped 90, 180, and 270 degrees, and flipped horizontally, to create mirrored image pairs. If you type the alphabet in Microsoft Word at 36 points, the individual glyphs come together to form larger glyphs composed of either four or eight characters. For the typing sequence to create the larger glyphs at 72 points, use the second character guide with an alphabetical font that has a full upper and lower case character set.

KleinKarpets is named for, and dedicated to, Manfred Klein, whose experiments with three dimensional fonts were my inspiration.
